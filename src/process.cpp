// --- reporting a replacement that failed -----------------------------------
//
// THE REPLACEMENT HAPPENS IN THE DUPLICATE, SO ITS FAILURE WAS REPORTED TO
// NOBODY.
//
// A program is started here by duplicating this image and replacing the
// duplicate. The replacement is the part that can fail --- the name is absent,
// or is a directory, or is not a program, or may not be executed --- and it
// fails inside an image the caller does not have. This implementation ended
// that image with 127 and answered `kal_ok' with a handle, so a caller learned
// something was wrong only by waiting and reading 127, which is exactly what a
// program that RAN and exited 127 reports.
//
// WHAT THAT COST, MEASURED BY A CONSUMER RATHER THAN HERE. openkal-musl
// expresses `execve' as starting a program and ending with its status, so a
// name that could not be started ended the CALLING program with 127 instead of
// returning -1. musl's `execvp' issues one `execve' per PATH entry and needs
// each to return, so the search could not survive its first miss: `bwrap',
// installed at /usr/bin/bwrap, was reported as not installed. openkal-linux#13,
// nine of nineteen test failures.
//
// openkal-musl 0.10.0 answers the part it can --- it asks `kal_fs_info' whether
// the name is there before starting. It cannot answer the rest: openkal reports
// no execute permission, so "present and not executable" is invisible above
// this line. It is not invisible HERE. The duplicate knows precisely why, and
// this is the channel that carries it.

// The arrangement is the ordinary one: a pipe whose ends close when the image is
// replaced. Nothing arrives ⇒ the replacement happened. A value arrives ⇒ it did
// not, and the value says why.

// that is true of a unit. A unit exists because its members include programs the
// caller never held a handle to and cannot enumerate --- and a request that any
// one of them may ignore does not terminate the unit, it terminates the part of
// it that agreed.
//
// Measured with a consumer's own test: a shell that traps the polite signal
// and loops. Asked politely, the unit outlived every deadline; the caller's
// escalation could not help, because openkal has no vocabulary for "and this
// time I mean it" --- it has no signals at all.
//
// ⇒ So the operation does what its name says. WHAT THIS COSTS IS REAL: a
// member gets no chance to clean up, where on a system programmed directly a
// caller would send the polite signal first and wait. A caller that wants that
// still has it --- `kal_process_terminate' upon the member it holds --- and what it
// cannot do is ask a unit politely.
//
// A GROUP IS NAMED BY A PROCESS IDENTIFIER, AND THOSE ARE REUSED. Once the
// program that formed the group has ended and the numbers have wrapped, this can
// reach a different group. That is what this system does --- every program that
// calls `killpg' lives with it --- and the interface records it rather than
// reading as though it were not so.

//
// A HANDLER AND NOT A WAITING CONTEXT, AND THE REASON IS WHICH ONE CAN BE
// ARMED WITHOUT DISTURBING A PROGRAM THAT NEVER ASKS. Consuming these signals
// from a context of its own would require them BLOCKED IN EVERY context, and
// blocking is per-context and inherited: a program that already had contexts
// running when it first asked would have some that still take the default
// action, and a program that never asks would have been made unkillable at
// startup. A disposition is per PROGRAM and can be installed at any moment.
//
// The handler does two things, and both are safe to do from one: store a word,
// and wake whoever waits on it. `kal_task_wait' is what a caller waits with, so
// the wake is the same operation `kal_task_wake' performs --- issued here as the
// raw call, because a handler may not enter code that takes a lock.
//
// THE RESTORER IS SUPPLIED HERE ON ONE ARCHITECTURE AND BY THE KERNEL ON THE
// OTHER. On x86_64 a disposition installed without SA_RESTORER faults on return
// from the handler --- the C library normally supplies the three instructions,
// and this implementation has no C library beneath it. On aarch64 the kernel
// supplies it and the flag must NOT be set.
