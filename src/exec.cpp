// no condition upon either step, so this implementation provides the interface
// unconditionally --- unlike one of the other systems, where the same interface
// is available only to a program produced in a particular way, which clause 6.5
// covers and which is not this system's case.
//
// The reservation is not made executable at the outset even though this kernel
// would permit it. Two of the three environments the specification targets
// refuse a mapping that is both, so an implementation that returned one here
// would be offering a program a shape it could not use elsewhere --- and the
// program would discover that only on the other system. The interface states
// the narrower contract and this implementation keeps to it.

    // THE INSTRUCTION CACHE IS NOT INVALIDATED HERE, AND ONE OF THE THREE
    // IMPLEMENTATIONS DOES INVALIDATE IT. THE ASYMMETRY HAS A RULE.
    //
    // A processor with separate caches for data and instructions has just had
    // bytes written through the data path that it is about to fetch through the
    // instruction path, and nothing in the protection call makes the second path
    // observe the first's writes.
    //
    // THE SPECIFICATION PLACES THE MAINTENANCE UPON THE PROGRAM, and the
    // conformance suite performs it itself and says why: the program is the
    // party that knows which bytes it wrote. So an implementation that performs
    // it is being helpful rather than conforming, and one that does not is not
    // deficient.
    //
    // AND THE ONLY MEANS AVAILABLE HERE IS ONE THIS IMPLEMENTATION MAY NOT
    // USE. `__builtin___clear_cache' expands to nothing on x86_64 and becomes a
    // CALL into the compiler's support library on the other two architectures
    // --- `__riscv_flush_icache' on riscv64. This implementation is linked into
    // programs that carry no other runtime, so acquiring that dependency to
    // perform an operation the specification does not require of it is not a
    // trade worth making.
    //
    // MEASURED, AND NOT ON THIS SYSTEM. openkal-macos added the builtin on
    // the reading that aarch64 would expand it inline, and its own independence
    // check reported within the hour:
    //
    //     obj/exec.o references a symbol it must not: ___clear_cache
    //
    // ⇒ The three implementations share a rule rather than an accident:
    //
    //     an implementation performs the maintenance where its environment
    //     offers it as a CALL of the environment's own --- openkal-windows has
    //     `FlushInstructionCache' --- and does not where the only means is a
    //     compiler builtin that becomes a dependency upon the compiler's
    //     support library.
    //
    // All three agree about what the PROGRAM must do, which is what the
    // specification actually states.
